## Hello!

Hello dear world! :tada: It is so good to see you! :confetti_ball:

There isn't much going on here right now. I am just getting started with becoming a software developer and getting into github.
Please feel appreciated!

That's it for now.

## Thank you!

Thank you for visiting my first github repo!
Have a nice day!
